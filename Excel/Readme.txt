Excel is one of the best platform to learn Data Analytics from scratch. 
Excel introduces more than 500 formulas in Jun 2023.
It will be added day by day 
Here, I have collected some datasets in kaggle which is in .csv or .xlsx file format. 
This will be helpful to analyse the datasets.
And also I used real time datasets during data analytics internship. 
That will be helpful to analyse current trends and requirements using that datasets.
